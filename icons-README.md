# Extension Icons

This extension requires icon files for the Chrome Web Store and browser UI:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons
You can create these icons using any graphics software. The icons should:
- Be simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use colors that work well on both light and dark backgrounds
- Represent the image extraction/download functionality
- Follow Chrome's design guidelines

## Temporary Solution
For testing purposes, you can:
1. Create simple PNG files with the required dimensions
2. Use online icon generators
3. Convert from SVG or other formats

The extension will work without icons, but they improve the user experience.
